I was so impressed with Sue's ability to take my girl's styles and wishes to create such beautiful designs that were to what they wanted for their special day! Everything came out so beautiful and exactly what they wanted. She goes above and beyond to provide great customer service and make sure your venue looks perfect on time for the day. She was able to provide ideas promptly based on our communications. Flowers were fresh and held up perfectly. I would recommend for any occasion.",
